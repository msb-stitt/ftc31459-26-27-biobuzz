/**
 * L8: drive around while two localizers disagree.
 *
 * <p>Panels draws the follower's pose, its aim point and the path on the
 * field. Your localizer is published as Localizer/driveWheelEncoders/x_in and
 * friends, and the robot's own is Localizer/pinPoint/x_in -- so graph the two
 * against each other, then measure the robot with a tape and see which one was
 * right.
 *
 * <p>Both of them count encoders. What differs is which wheels: yours reads the
 * four that push, and the Pinpoint reads two that only measure.
