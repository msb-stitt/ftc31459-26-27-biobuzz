 * A finished mecanum drivetrain, for code that is not a lesson.
 *
 * <p>Everything a drivetrain does is in {@link CorbelsDriveTrain}. This fills in
 * the one part that class leaves open, with the mixing Pedro's own
 * {@code Mecanum} uses, so autonomous behaves exactly as it did before we
 * replaced Pedro's drivetrain with our own.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately a separate file from the lessons' own drivetrain, and
 * deliberately the same four lines. A lesson's copy has blanks in it for a
 * student to fill, so the tuners and the system identification tools cannot
 * depend on it.
