/**
 * A working mecanum drivetrain, for code that is not a lesson.
 *
 * <p>The lessons from L110 on extend it, and each writes one method: {@link #mix}
 * in L110, {@code setCommandedWheelSpeeds} in L190 and {@code wheelTicks} in
 * L195. The only part left open is {@link #mix}, and {@link CorbelsMecanum}
 * fills it in.
 *
 * <p><b>Which way is positive.</b> Pedro's three numbers are
 * {@code forwardSpeed} along the robot's nose, {@code strafeLeftSpeed} towards
 * the robot's left, and {@code turnCcwSpeed} counter-clockwise seen from above.
 * Every name in this project carries the direction for that reason, and a rate
 * in real units carries the unit too: {@code forwardSpeedInPerS},
 * {@code turnCcwSpeedRadPerS}. The frame itself is Pedro's, defined at
 * https://pedropathing.com/docs/pathing/reference/coordinates
 *
 * <p><b>Why we have one at all.</b> Pedro ships a complete mecanum drivetrain,
 * {@code com.pedropathing.revhub.drivetrains.Mecanum}, and a team may simply use
 * it. Ours exists for two reasons: so the students understand how the motors in
 * a drivetrain are controlled, and so a teleop can beat the follower at the
 * wheels, which Pedro's has no door for. Everything Pedro's {@code Drivetrain}
 * interface asks for is answered here, and each of those methods says above it
 * where it came from.
 *
 * <p><b>Who writes to the motors.</b> Only {@link #writeWheels}, through the
 * {@link CachedMotor} wrappers, and only {@link #drive} and {@link #stop} call
 * it. {@code drive} is final so that brake mode cannot be missed: a subclass
 * that replaced it would replace that line too.
