/**

 * <p>A stick let go does not read exactly zero, so the robot creeps. A deadband
 * fixes it: anything smaller than {@link #DEADBAND} is treated as nothing, and
 * everything else is passed through untouched.
 *
 * <p>{@link LessonsDriveTrain#deadband} is this lesson's own work, and it is an
 * {@code if} and an {@code else} rather than anything clever. It goes in the
 * drivetrain because every later lesson shapes its sticks the same way. Both
 * sticks go through it here, so the same number is used twice.
