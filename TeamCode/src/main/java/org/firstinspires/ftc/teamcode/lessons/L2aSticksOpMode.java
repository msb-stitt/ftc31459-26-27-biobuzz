/**
 * L2a: read the gamepad and write down what it says. Nothing moves.
 *
 * <p>The robot can sit on the floor for this one. Every number the driver's
 * hands make goes to Panels and into the flight log, and the wheels are not
 * touched until L2b.
 *
 * <p>This is also the first look at the four methods every OpMode has.
 * {@code init} runs once when INIT is pressed, {@code start} once when PLAY is
 * pressed, {@code loop} over and over until STOP, and {@code stop} once at the
 * end. The {@code Before} and {@code After} calls are the robot's own
 * housekeeping -- hardware, the flight log, Panels -- and the code between them
 * is this lesson's.
 *
 * <p>A stick pushed away from the driver reads negative, which is backwards
 * from how anyone thinks about it, so every stick gets a minus sign on the way
 * in. After that, forward is positive.
 *
 * <p>Four kinds of value get logged here: a {@code double} for a stick, a
 * {@code boolean} for a button, an {@code int} for the loop count, and a
 * {@code String} for an event. The loop count and the running time are here to
 * show how; the robot already logs both for itself, which is worth knowing
 * before writing it a second time.
 *
 * <p>Passes when: LessonsTest.l2a_logsEveryStickAndTheAButton and
 * LessonsTest.l2a_saysWhenTheButtonIsPressedAndReleased
