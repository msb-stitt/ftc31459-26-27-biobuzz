/**
 * Runs one OpMode in the simulator until Ctrl-C, publishing to NetworkTables

 *
 * <p>{@link SimArgs} holds the four forms, the 21 controls that can be set and
 * the usage text; {@code --help} prints it. A usage error is one line on
 * standard error and exit 2, with no stack trace.
 *
 * <p>An OpMode is named by what follows {@link #PACKAGE}, so any OpMode in the
 * project can be run. A control option fills a staging gamepad that is copied
 * into {@code gamepad1} every loop, and {@code --pad} fills both slots from real
 * gamepads instead; {@link SimPads} says which gamepad is which.
 *
 * <p>Everything periodic runs on {@link SimTicker}'s 10 ms grid, measured from
 * the clock read when the run starts: the gamepads are read and the simulated
 * robot steps every instant it wakes on, the gestures are read every fifth
 * instant, and the rescan runs every twenty-fifth with the off-rest report
 * beside it for {@code --pad-check}. A slow pass is charged to itself rather
 * than to the periods after it, and an instant it ran through is skipped rather
 * than caught up.
 *
 * <p>A pass advances the simulated clock by the real time since the last pass
 * rather than by one instant, so the robot moves at the speed it would move on
 * the field however long a pass takes. Measured on this bench on 2026-09-29,
 * driving straight at full power and reading the pose off NetworkTables: an
 * OpMode burning 25 ms in every loop ran at 0.398 of real time while a pass
 * advanced a fixed 10 ms, and at 1.001 once it advanced what it measured. An
 * OpMode with nothing in its loop runs at 1.000 either way.
 * {@link SimTicker#stepWorth} says what a step is worth and bounds it.
 *
 * <p>Passes when: SimRunTest, SimArgsTest.
