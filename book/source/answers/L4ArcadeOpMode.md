        //       forward comes from the left stick's y axis, turn from the right
        //       stick's x axis, and BOTH need a minus sign -- the note above says
        //       why the turn one does. Log them as command/forward and
        //       command/turn_ccw so Panels can draw them.
        double forwardSpeed = 0;
        double turnCcwSpeed = 0;
```
