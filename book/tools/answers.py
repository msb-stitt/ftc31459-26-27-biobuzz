"""Generate the answer pages from the two lesson lines.

For every lesson file the lessons line marks with a TODO, this reads the same
path from the solutions line and writes what fills each blank. Both files come
out of git rather than the working tree, so the answers are pinned to the
commits keep.toml names and a regeneration gives the same pages.

Aligning the two files with difflib rather than parsing Java is deliberate: a
blank is wherever the two lines differ, which is exactly what the student has to
write. Every difference is emitted, and one that carries no TODO is labelled as
such, so a page cannot quietly leave a blank out.

Run it with --check to compare against what is committed instead of writing.
