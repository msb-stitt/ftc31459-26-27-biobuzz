Every table on the page is read out of the mytry files as they stand once every

the same application the answers are generated from, so the page and the code
cannot drift apart: what a student is told to run is what the code says.

Nothing here is written by hand except the headings and the sentences under them.
A name, a test, a method or a log key on the page is there because it is in the
