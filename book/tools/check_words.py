"""Check every page against its word ceiling, and that it has one.

Prose written by an agent gets longer every pass and nothing pulls it back, so
each page carries a ceiling set when the page was accepted. Raising one is a
visible line in a diff.

A page with no entry in the register fails too: a new page states its ceiling in
the commit that adds it.
